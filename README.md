### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

Allow me to reintroduce myself my name is Sam

I'm a freelance data professional and continuous learner of all things data science and development.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some interesting business intelligence projects to help SME health and wellness businesses use data to make better and more profitable decisions. 

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with people with good energy on interesting and impactful projects. If you run a brick and mortar health and wellness business or are in the personal coaching industry and are looking for ways to optimise what you do then I'd be open to having a conversation about how we can collaborate.   

- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a massive sports fan so I also do sports analytics as a passion project. If you love football, basketball or combat sports and want to talk xG, VORP and RPM then hit me up!
