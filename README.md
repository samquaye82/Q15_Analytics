### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

Allow me to reintroduce myself my name is Sam

I'm a freelance data professional and continuous learner of all things data science and personal development.

- ðŸ”­ I focus on business intelligence projects for SME consumer businesses that specialise in sports, health and fitness.
- I empower them to use data to make better and more profitable decisions. 

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with people with good energy on interesting and impactful projects. If you run or represent a business that fits the above description and are looking for ways to optimise what you do then I'd be open to having a conversation about how we can collaborate.   

- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a massive sports fan so I also do sports analytics as a passion project. If you love football (not NFL), basketball or combat sports and want to talk xG, VORP and RPM then hit me up!

- ðŸ“« You can find me on LinkedIn here: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-quaye-q15-analytics/]
